# Ram Code

RamCode will allow students to answer simple coding questions that are focused on filling in blanks in specific methods as well as some comprehension questions that are programming related. The users will also be able to log into the system to answer questions and allow them to see how many questions they have answered correctly and incorrectly. Teachers will also be able to create new questions to add to the database. RamCode was  developed using AngularJS for the frontend, Express for the web app framework, NodeJS for the backend and MySQL for the database storage.
